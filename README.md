### Deprecated,
Unfortunately this exploit has been fixed within a day of it being found.

### Discord Banner Exploit
This is a bot to help people with using the new discord banners without having a verified server, the feautre is coming to normal servers soon, however this takes advantage of an exploit to use it sooner.

#### How to do it?
First of all, make sure you have a bot made ready in https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ so that you can quickly grab the token and get started as soon as possible.

Download the zip of this repo and extract, run ``npm install`` like you would any other NodeJS application, but then this is where it gets different. Go into the ``node_modules`` folder follow this path ``discord.js/src/structures/`` and drop in the file located in the ``exploit`` folder, this should replace an already present file. Then run it as normal (``npm start``).

You should now be able to use the command ``!setbanner <bannerurl>`` where the ``<bannerurl>`` part is a url of the image you would like.
